#midPointComplexDemoKubernetes

# This project migrates an existing
# demo environment based on Pavol Mederly's
# "complex" demo into Google Kubernetes

# It is based on:
# https://github.internet2.edu/docker/midPoint_container/tree/master/demo/grouper
# and is a collection of scripts to run
# docker and kubectl commands, along with
# some YAMLs originally generated by Kompose.

# Before running any scripts, be sure to
# set $PROJECT_ID to your GCP project
# for example export PROJECT_ID=rcgrant-kromhout-test
# And your kubectl set to an appropriate context
# The build.sh script under demo/grouper
# can be used to build the environment once
# you have configured kubectl to an existing
# context / cluster.

# The tag-images.sh and push-images.sh will
# need to be adjusted for your context / cluster
# and run before the first build.sh run
